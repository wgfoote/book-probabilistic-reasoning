<p>Richard McElreath starts in earnest with <em>Sampling the Imaginary</em>. Insofar as the imaginary, as things, emanate from our imagination, and thus meets reality somewhere, then this makes sense epistemologically. The imaginary is otherwise a very ontological <em>thing</em> in our minds, and we might even share that thing.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Taleb_2004"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> notes that black swans were imaginary, of course until they were discovered in Australia. The imaginary mental being lurks in our consciousness. An example is the exclamation by DiFenetti (<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="DiFinetti1958"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>) that <em>PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST</em>. So true! This is a concept that many share but it is a construct in our minds, like every single model in mental existence, even those written on very real paper.</p>

<p>A popular, easy both to imagine and construct, approach to mashing data into hypotheses is the <em>grid approximation</em> approach. The grid we imagine here is are the 101 possible and quite hypothetical probabilities of a positive result in, say, testing for a novel virus. In this scenario we are sampling from all 8 zip coded in the Bronx. Suppose we find 2 positive zip codes. Following Kurzâ€™s lead we tibble into a solution.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s transform from the cloud of unknowing into the frequency of ways in which 8 zip codes can plausibly have 2 positive results. Letâ€™s also add a vertical line to indicate the mode of this posterior distribution. The <code>tidybayes</code> package has a slew of useful summarizing statistics, including the <code>Mode()</code> which we use below to find the proportion of tests that correspond to the posteriorâ€™s mode. The <em>Maximum A Posteriori</em> (aka MAP) hypothesis is just the mode, that is, the most frequently occurring value of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, This will be one point estimate we can report.</p>

<p>Other measures of tendency include the quantiles. We can summarize our testing results in a number of ways depending on the purpose of the report and the desires of the client. Here is one way using the <code>summarize</code> function the tidyverseâ€™s <code>dplyr</code> package along with a few <code>tidybayes</code> functions, of course, for good measure.</p>
<div id="skin-in-the-game" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> Skin in the game</h3>
<p>We have let <span class="math inline">\(h = p\)</span> be our hypothesized proportion of zip codes testing positive. Now we suppose we are at a game of chance (they do exist in the Bronx!) and guess <span class="math inline">\(d = positive\)</span> for the next text. The house will pay us $1 if we guess exactly right. If we guess wrong we get docked by an amount proportional to the absolute value of the distance <span class="math inline">\(d - p\)</span> we deviate. We now have a loss function.</p>
<p>We also now call <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> a decision. But it is a decision based on a set of hypotheses about decisions, our prior beliefs about those decisions, and driven by the likelihood of seeing decision outcomes in data, a posterior implication. The implication is the plausibility of those decisions logically compatible with experience of observing decision outcomes.</p>
<p>Following de Moivreâ€™s (<span class="citation">Moivre (<a href="#ref-DeMoivre1756" role="doc-biblioref">1756</a>)</span>) <em>doctrine of chance</em> we compute our expected loss. This approach constructs a criterion, also known as an objective function. The absolute value function is also known as the check function and is used by <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Koenker2005"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> to build a whole family of quantile regression models the parameters of which are solutions to linear programming models. Here is what the loss objective function looks like.</p>

<p>Here we have deviations of a <code>p_grid</code> value <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> from a range of possible guesses <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. From high school algebra we might remember that the rate of change of the absolute value function is this v-shaped beast. It is a beast because the derivative, that is, the slope, is not defined at <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Instead we must gingerly approach the value from the left and the right. Here finally is the check function for a guess of 0.75, as in our zip code example.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s guess that <span class="math inline">\(d=0.5\)</span> and try this value on our simulated grid by computed the weighted average of losses with weights equal to the posterior distribution. We can use the <code>summarize()</code> function from the <code>dplyr</code> package in the tidyverse ecosystem.

<p>McElreath uses the <code>sapply()</code> function from base R to vectorize a calculation of losses using a loss function. The <code>purrr::map()</code> function essentially does the same job and we can see more applications of the <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org"><strong>purrr</strong> package</a> <span class="citation">(Henry and Wickham <a href="#ref-R-purrr" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, which is itself part of the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org"><strong>tidyverse</strong></a> and of the <code>map()</code> family <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html">here</a> or <a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls01_map-name-position-shortcuts.html">here</a> or <a href="https://data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-the-purrr-package-in-r/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>map()</code> will take an input and run this input through whatever function we might dream up. So letâ€™s make up a <code>make_loss()</code> function out of the <code>summarize()</code> experiment above. Typically this is how we construct functions. We first run through a set of routimes. Once we are satisfied with the behavior of those routines, we enshrine them in functions for repeated use. First a <code>mutate()</code> creates a vector of weighted losses, then the <code>summarize()</code> verb finishes the calculate of the sumproducts.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s identify the optimal, that is, the minimum loss using the <code>filter()</code> verb. In this way we can build a vertical line to indicate the optimal loss. A ribbon will fill the area under the loss curve. We can interact with the graph using the <code>ggploty()</code> function on the <code>ggplot()</code> object <code>plt</code>.</p>

<p>We saved the exact minimum value as <code>min_loss[1]</code>, which is 0.7137137. Within sampling error, this is the posterior 50th quantile, the median, as depicted by our <code>samples</code>, except for the sampling error. It is the median as it is the optimal choice of decision based on the absolute deviation function.</p>

<p>We will use the <code>quantile()</code> to define boundaries within the posterior distribution. This function also provides thresholds for extreme values in the distribution, a measure call the <em>Value-at-risk</em> in finance.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1.1</span> An Aside</h4>
<p>Even more interesting is the idea we can find a middling measure that minimizes the sum of absolute deviations of data around an as yet unspecified parameter (too many <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>!).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
SAD = \Sigma_{i=1}^5 |Y_i - m|
\]</span></p>
<p>Yes, it is SAD, the sum of absolute deviations. This is our foray into rank-oder statistics, quite a bit different in nature than the arithmetic mean of <span class="math inline">\(SSE\)</span> fame, whic we will get to in due time. We get to basic counting when we try to mind the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> that minimizes SAD. To illustrate this suppose our data is all positive (ratio data in fact). If <span class="math inline">\(m=0.5\)</span> then the function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(Y;m) = |Y-m|
\]</span>
has this appearance, the so-called check function.</p>

<p>Intuitively, half the graph seems to be the left of <span class="math inline">\(m=0.5\)</span>, the other have is to the right. Letâ€™s look at the first derivative of the check function with respect to changes in <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, just like we did with each term in <span class="math inline">\(SSE\)</span>. Notice that the (eyeballed) rise over run, i..e., slope, before <span class="math inline">\(m=5\)</span> is -1, and after it is +1. At <span class="math inline">\(m=0.5\)</span> there is no slope thatâ€™s immediately meaningful.</p>
<p>We have two cases to consider. First <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> can be less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(Y-m \leq 0\)</span>. In this case</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{d\,\,(Y-m)_{\leq0}}{dY} = -1
\]</span></p>
<p>This corresponds exactly to negatively sloped line accumulating like the seive of Erasthenes into our supposed <span class="math inline">\(m=0.5\)</span> in the plot.</p>
<p>Second, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> can be greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(Y-m \geq 0\)</span>. In this case</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{d\,\,(Y-m)_{\geq0}}{dY} = +1
\]</span></p>
<p>also correpsonding to the positively sloped portion of the graph.</p>
<p>Another graph is in order to imagine this derivative.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s all or nothing for the derivative, a classic step function. We use this fact in the following (near) finale in our search for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Back to <span class="math inline">\(SAD\)</span>.</p>
<p>We are looking for the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> that minimizes <span class="math inline">\(SAD\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
SAD = \Sigma_{i=1}^N |Y_i - m| = |Y_1-m| + \ldots + |Y_N-m|
\]</span></p>
<p>If we take the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(SAD\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> data points, we get <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> minus 1s and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> plus ones in our sum because each and every <span class="math inline">\(|Y_i-m|\)</span> could either be greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> or less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, we just just donâ€™t know which, so we need to consider both cases at once. We also donâ€™t know off hand how many data points are to the left or the right of the value of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> that minimizes <span class="math inline">\(SAD\)</span>!</p>
<p>Letâ€™s play a little roulette and let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be the number of (unknown) points to the left of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> points to the right. Then <span class="math inline">\(SAD\)</span> looks like it is split into two terms, just like the two intervals leading up to and away from the red dot at the bottom of the check function.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
SAD = \Sigma_{i=1}^R |Y_i - m| + \Sigma_{i=1}^R |Y_i - m| = (|Y_1-m| + \ldots + |Y_L-m|) + (|Y_1-m| + \ldots + |Y_R-m|)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{d\,\,SAD}{dY} = \Sigma_{i=1}^L (-1) + \Sigma_{i=1}^R (+1) = (-1)L+ (+1)R
\]</span></p>
<p>When we set this result to zero for the first order condition for an optimum we get a possibly strange, but appropriate result. The tradeoff between left and right must offset one another exactly.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(-1)L + (+1)R = 0
\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[
L = R
\]</span>
Whatever number of points are to the left must also be to the right of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> points also include <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(L/N\geq1/2\)</span> as well as for the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> points if they include <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(R/N\geq1/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have arrived at what a median is.</p>
<p>Now we come up with a precise statement of the middle of a data series, the notorious median. We let <span class="math inline">\(P()\)</span> be the proportion of data points at and above (if <span class="math inline">\(Y \geq M\)</span>) or at and below (<span class="math inline">\(Y \leq m\)</span>).</p>
<p>THe median, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, is the first time a data point in a data series reaches <em>both</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P(Y \leq m) \geq 1/2\)</span> (from minimum data point) <em>and</em></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(P(Y \geq m) \geq 1/2\)</span> (from the maximum data point)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Itâ€™s logic again with these conjunctive statements. That definition will work for us whether each data point is equally likely (<span class="math inline">\(1/N\)</span>) as in a so-called uninformative prior or from grouped data with symmetric or skewed relative frequency distributions.</p>

<p>Based on quadratic loss <span class="math inline">\((d - p)^2\)</span>, the exact minimum value is 0.6996997. Within sampling error. There might be a bit of a shock that this is just the arithmetic mean of our <code>samples</code>. An aside will be in order.</p>

<p>The arithmetic mean takes no notice at all of the possibility that different outcomes have different weights. It is this starting position that often frequentists, including me in some realizations, can fail to notice the shape of data, always as that shape is really formed by the knower-analystâ€™s assumptions.</p>

<p>This plot depicts the sum of squared deviations for a grid of potential values of what the data points deviate from, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Use of such a criterion allows us a clear and in this case unique calculation of the best linear estimator for the mean. We hover over the graph and brush over the area around bottom of the function a little below the median.</p>

<p>Simply putting the cursor on the red dot indicates a solution: <span class="math inline">\(m=\)</span> 1.</p>
<p>A bit of calculus confirms the brute force choice of the arithmetic mean that minimizes the sum of squared deivations about the mean.</p>
<p>First, the sum of squared errors (deviations) of the <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> data points about a mean of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
SSE = \Sigma_{i=1}^5 (Y_i - m)^2
\]</span></p>
<p>Second, we derive the first derivative of <span class="math inline">\(SSE\)</span> with reapect to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, holding all else (e.g., sums of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>) and set the derivative equal to zero for the first order condition for an optimum.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{d\,\,SSE}{dm} = -2\left(\Sigma_{i=1}^5 (Y_i - m)\right) = 0
\]</span>
Here we used the chain and power rules of differentiation.</p>
<p>Third, we solve for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to find</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
m = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^5 Y_i}{N}=0.5043659
\]</span></p>
<p>Close enough for us? This is none other than the arithmetic mean. We can perform similar procedure to get the sample means of the y-intercept <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> and slope <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> of the relationship</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_i = b_0 + b_1 X_i + e_i
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> data points try tp explain movements in the <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> data points. This will be the subject of our next chapter, an excursion into McElreathâ€™s geocentric models.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s try Laplaceâ€™s quadratic approximation technique instead of the brute force grid. This approach takes advantage of the observation that around the mode of the posterior distribution, the distribution is approximately Gaussian-shaped. A Gaussian shape is just a quadratic combination of the hypotheses.</p>
<p>Here is a version for the simplest model that is not binomial (or poisson for that matter). The Laplace quadratic approximation technique has two steps.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Find the optimal values of posterior parameters (MAP).</p></li>
<li><p>Given the optimal value of posterior parameters and their interactions across the data, simulate posterior values of parameters and data predictions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will begin to control under and over-flow issues (really small and really large numbers) by using the following relationship between the product, here, of two likelihoods, <span class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_2\)</span>, and the exponent of the sum of logarithms of the two likelihoods.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p_1p_2 = e^{log(p_1)+log(p_2)}
\]</span>
We shift gears out of first gear binomial models into the second gear of a simple mean and standard deviation of a set of continuous data like temperature or electrical usage or even square hectares of land versus water. We suppose our data looks like this (simulated to protect the innocent) and pretend we are energy managers who are reviewing a facilityâ€™s electricity usage per minute. The dimensions of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are kilo-watt hours per minute.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s the data <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=1 \cdots 20\)</span> and its specification in R. Running <em>toy</em> simulation models like this help us to be sure our more realistic models are working correctly.</p>
<p>For the priors we will let the mean be normally distributed (Gaussian) and possibly range from 0 to 100, since we do not know any differently at this stage. Normal distributions are symmetric and are almost triangular looking if we squint at them.</p>
<p>We let the standard deviation take on a log Gaussian shape, bounded at 0, since standard deviations are always greater than or equal to zero. The lognormal distribution will have a shape that feels a bit exponential, almost chi-squared. But thatâ€™s a consideration for later. Thereâ€™s an assumption we can build in! The full model looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
y_i &amp; \sim \operatorname{Normal}(\mu, \sigma) \\
\mu &amp; \sim \operatorname{Normal}(0,100) \\
\sigma &amp; \sim \operatorname{LogNormal}(0,10) \\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The likelihood function for data <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{Pr}(y_i \mid \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\operatorname{exp}\left[\frac{(y_i - \mu)^2}{2\sigma}\right]
\]</span>
Ye gads! But not to worry, this density function is computed in R with <code>dnorm()</code>. The beast of a formula has <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in it so it very likely has something to do with circles and trigonometry, again for later, some day. It is definitely easier to use the <code>~</code> language above to specify models.</p>
<p>We set the feature to take logarithms of this computation with a <code>log=T</code> argument in <code>dnorm()</code>. This function will compute for the two parameterss in <code>p</code> and the data in <code>y</code>, the log posterior density. It we raise this number to the power of <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> we get the original product of posterior likelihoods. We note how we incorporate the two assumptions about the parameters as priors in the computation.</p>

<p>So this works by inserting the data <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> and initial guesses about parameter values into an optimizer that searche across values of <code>mu</code> and <code>sigma</code> for the maximum log-likelihood of seeing all of the data <code>y</code> given a <code>mu</code> and <code>signma</code>.

<p>What we get from this exercise is a lot more than arithmetic means and standard deviations. We are analyst-skeptics. We need to learn something about how the variations in the data reflect in variations in the mean and standard deviation, as well as how the mean and standard deviation end up interacting as well.</p>
<p>We get the interactions of the mean and standard deviatino from the <code>hessian</code> matrix computed during the computes the variance-covariance of the solution 9.9951265, 5.3978933. We are not done! Next we use the fit parameters that have located the Maximum A Posteriori values of the two parameters $= $ 9.9951265 and $= $ 5.3978933 to generate posterior predictive samples, plot them, talk about them, and then we are done (for the moment!).</p>
<p>If we invert the negative of the hessian matrix, we get back the variance-covariance matrix of the two parameters. Frequentist-while, the square root of the diagonal of this inverted hessian matrix can form the basis of t-tests of the null hypothesis that <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 0\)</span> or some other target value <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>. But we are not frequentists, so simulation-while we return to sampling.</p>

<p>In order to sample predictive posterior views, really hypotheses of what might be, of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> as Gaussian variates, we will need to take into account not only the means and variances of the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> parameters, but we will need to include how these parameters would vary with one another with covariances 0. The <code>mvtnorm</code> package will come to our aid. First the samples, then add a simulation of predictions for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We will use the <code>coda</code> package to display the distributions this time, since it is a popular way to visualize Monte Carlo simulations of the Markov Chain species.
Essentially this is the package that McElreathâ€™s <code>rethinking</code> package employs.</p>

<p>Here is a <strong>high density interval</strong> view of the modes of the three samplings. A 95% interval width allows us to say that the values of posterior parameters and predictions are between lower and upper bounds with 95% compatibility with the data. These are compatibility, plausibility, posterior probability, credibility intervals. That last adjective is for the insurance analysts in the gang. The <code>pivot_longer()</code> is preferred over <code>gather()</code>. The <code>name</code> is automatically generated from column names in the tibble, while <code>value</code> is the new array of sampled parameters and predictions.</p>

<p>Was that enough? For now at least. We accomplished a lot. But perhaps the biggest takeaway is our new found ability to deploy simulation with probability with compatibility of hypotheses with data to arrive at learning about the data. We learned because we inferred.</p>
<p>Up next, we gather our wits together to rebuild the workhorse model, the linear regression, in the image and likeness of a probabilistic simulator.</p>
