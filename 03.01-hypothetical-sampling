# Sampling the Hypothetical

## On your marks ...

Richard McElreath calls this section _Sampling the Imaginary_. Insofar as the imaginary emanates from our imagination, and thus meets reality somewhere, then this makes sense epistemologically. The imaginary is otherwise a very ontological _thing_ in our minds, and we might even share that thing. @Taleb_2004 notes that black swans were imaginary, of course until they were discovered in Australia. The imaginary mental being lurks in our consciousness. An example is the exclamation by DiFenetti (@DiFinetti_1970) that _PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST_. So true! This is a concept that many share but it is a construct in our minds, like every single model in mental existence, even those written on very real paper.
